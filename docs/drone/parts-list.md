# Parts List for Drone

## Overview
For the parts, ensure that all parts are bought exactly. This is because previous drone team members from Fall 2019 have ensured that all the parts bought were fully compatible. Replacing a part with another may lead to burnt ESCs or **exploding LiPo** batteries.<br> Please be careful.
